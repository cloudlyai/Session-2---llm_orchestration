# Session 1 — LLM Orchestration

Part of the **AI Engineering Course** — a hands-on video course for software engineers transitioning into AI engineering. This session covers the fundamentals of making calls to LLMs and chaining multiple providers together.

## What This Session Covers

- Chat completions API structure (messages array, roles: system / user / assistant)
- Calling three different LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini
- Multi-LLM chaining — the output of one model is passed as context to the next
- The difference between using native provider SDKs vs a unified abstraction layer (LiteLLM)
- Environment variable management with `.env` and `python-dotenv`

## The Demo — Multi-LLM Puzzle Chain

Both programs implement the same orchestration flow across three providers:

```
OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)      →  generates a puzzle
Anthropic (claude-3-haiku) →  receives the puzzle, generates a hint
Google (gemini-2.0-flash)  →  receives puzzle + hint, generates the solution
```

Each model's response is appended to the shared message history using `role: assistant` before being passed to the next model — this is the core pattern of multi-LLM chaining.

## Programs

### `llm_orchestration_standard.py`
Uses each provider's native SDK directly:
- `openai.OpenAI` for GPT
- `anthropic.Anthropic` for Claude
- `openai.OpenAI` with a custom `base_url` for Gemini (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

Demonstrates the SDK differences between providers and how each structures its responses.

### `llm_orchestration_litellm.py`
Same orchestration using [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) as a unified interface. A single `completion()` call works across all three providers — only the `model` string changes.

Demonstrates provider abstraction: swap models without rewriting integration code.

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.9+

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudlyai/Session-1---llm_orchestration.git
   cd Session-1---llm_orchestration
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai anthropic litellm python-dotenv
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
   ```

## Running

```bash
# Standard SDK approach
python llm_orchestration_standard.py

# LiteLLM unified approach
python llm_orchestration_litellm.py
```
